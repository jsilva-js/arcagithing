. visual elements exists within a two dimensional spatial plane
. spatial plane is a rectangular grid of NxN squares
. grid can be of NxN squares where 1 <= N <= 30
. grid height and width may not be equal
. squares can be of 10 disctinct colors
. data to represent visual elements (grid) is a list of N lists of numbers from 0 to 9 (representing the colored square)
. problem represents its model
. problems represents all problem
. problem has many example, a test and a solution
. test represents its model
. tests represents all test
. problem/test is the model of a problem test
. solution represents its model
. solutions represents all solution
. problem/solution is the model of a problem solution
. example represents its model
. examples represents all example
. solutions are output
. examples/output are solution
. not all outputs are solution
. input and output are grids
. test is an input
. input represent its model
. inputs represents all input
. example has input and output
. examples/output are solution
. example is a time-frame
. time-frame is a input grid transitioning to output grid as a result of one iteration of time
. problem/solution is the desired output of the problem/test input
. problem/example is the model of problem example
. problem/examples represents all examples of a problem
. input and output grid sizes may be different between problem/examples
. example/input or output represents input and output of an example
. examples/input and output represents theirselves of all example
. problems has unique set of logical laws that justify the changes between inputs and outputs
. law represents its model
. laws represents all law
. law is a abstract order that a problem/{examples & test} needs to follow to apply reason
. solution has one or many reason
. reason is a model
. reasons are all reason
. reason is a pattern found in problem/examples to apply on problem/test  
. problem/laws represents the laws for a specific problem
